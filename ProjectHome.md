The B method development process starts from an abstract model of a set of services that are to be developed, and includes formally verified refinements, which introduce implementation details. At a final refinement step these implementation details depend on the language for which code is to be generated. To rigorously develop Java Card Applications with the B method, then, it is necessary to model in B the constructs of Java Card, so that the gap between the B formally verified implementation model and the Java Card generated code is as small as it can be. On this subproject we are working on the specification of the Java Card to be used in the development of Java Card applications with B.
